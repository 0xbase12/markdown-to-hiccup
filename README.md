# markdown-to-hiccup

Simple library for converting markdown strings or files into Clojure/Script compatible hiccup data structures

## Installation
### Leiningen/Boot
`[markdown-to-hiccup "0.3.0"]`

### Clojure CLI/deps.edn
`markdown-to-hiccup {:mvn/version "0.3.0"}`

### Gradle
`compile 'markdown-to-hiccup:markdown-to-hiccup:0.3.0'`

## Usage
### Clojure and ClojureScript
Use md->hiccup to convert a markdown string to hiccup:
```
(ns example.core
	(:require [markdown-to-hiccup.core :as m]))

(m/md->hiccup "#Title")

=> [:html {} [:head {}] [:body {} [:h1 {} "Title"]]]
```

If you just want the hiccup without the html, head, and body tags, pass it through the component function:
```
(->> "#Title\n* Bullet"
     (m/md->hiccup)
     (m/component))
     
=> [:div {} [:h1 {} "Title"] [:ul {} [:li {} "Bullet"]]]

```

If you want a specific nested hiccup vector, use hiccup-in. It lets you specify the keywords
(and indices for matching neighbor hiccup elements) to extract nested hiccup:
```
(let [hiccup (md->hiccup "#Title\n#SecondTitle")]
	(hiccup-in hiccup :html :body :h1 0)) ;; note the integer paired with :h1
=> [:h1 {} "Title"]

vs.

(let [hiccup (md->hiccup "#Title\n#SecondTitle")]
	(hiccup-in hiccup :html :body :h1 1)) ;; note the integer paired with :h1
=> [:h1 {} "Title"]
```
### Clojure-only
Finally, for just Clojure, there is also a function for automatically reading in a markdown file from disk and outputting hiccup:
```
(m/file->hiccup file-path-to-markdown-file)

=> [:html {} [:head {}] [:body {} [:h1 {} "Title"]]]
```
